Mantra-py is a Python library to interact with the Mantra chain. The library is
composed by different modules:

- `client`: perform queries and transactions against a Mantra
node.
- `txbuilder`: build and sing transactions.
- `wallet`: create Mantra network wallets: mnemonic, pub/priv keys, and
addresses.
- `webhooks`: subscribe to Mantra network events.
